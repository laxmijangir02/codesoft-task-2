# CALCULATOR
a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It prompts the user to input two numbers and the desired operation, then performs the calculation and displays the result.
## How It Works:
1. The program defines four functions (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) for each arithmetic operation.
2. The calculator() function starts by greeting the user and prompting them to input two numbers.
3. It then presents the available operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and asks the user to choose one.
4. Based on the user's choice, it performs the corresponding operation and prints the result.
5. If the user chooses division, it checks if the second number is zero and avoids a division by zero error.

### This simple calculator handles basic operations and ensures user input is validated correctly. You can further enhance it by adding more operations, error handling, or even creating a GUI.
